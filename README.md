How to get started!
Get git going:
1. follow directions on git to connect to remote
2. you should have a local master and a remote, to check this type in "git remote -v"
3. you should have it say "origin git@github.com:..."

In commandline type each of the following:
1. npm install first to update
2. npm install -g nodemon
3. nodemon


To make sure branch is up to date:
1. type "git pull" (this pulls all updates from the master branch on the remote repository, *DO THIS BEFORE YOU START EACH TIME*)
2. make your changes
3. git commit -am"MESSAGE" (except change MESSAGE to describe the changes you made)
4. once you've got something working correctly type "git push" (this pushes your changes to the remote repository)

## If at anytime you're unsure of what changes you've made or aren't sure if you're up to date, type "git status"
